	<p>A small entry today, my friends have all gone back to the US, too bad they didn't book the later flight I had, otherwise
		we could have all gone to Tokyo together. There's a lot of things to do here in Tokyo, and the first thing I did was go visit
		the Sky Tree, which has taken the title of 'tallest building in Tokyo' away from Tokyo Tower. The view at night was alright,
		considering it was raining. I'll have to go again on a clear day, in order to get an actual view from there. I didn't have my
		camera charged, so I didn't get any pictures...
