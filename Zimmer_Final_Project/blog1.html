	<p>Today, my friends and I had gone to Omihachiman, a small town about a twenty minute train ride away from Kyoto, to see the
		'Drum Festival' that they were holding today. It was a very interesting experience, there were many groups of men, carrying 
		these large drums that looked like they weighed a ton. They were all carrying them to this shrine, where they would be blessed,
		then go on back to the street, following a circular path to start over again. There was also a lot of interesting stands 
		selling all sorts of foods, the best being some grilled chicken, and a stand selling freshly made smoothies. Oh, an odd thing
		that happened wsa that we ran into another American at the festival, and when he greeted me in english, I replied about 3 
		times in japanese before I responded in english. It's a good thing my friends were more prepared to talk to him than I was!</p>
